## Hey there 👋
I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science, hoping to specialize in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\
\
My academic focuses at the moment are **C++**, **HTML/CSS**, and **computer architecture**. 🔍 Meanwhile, my current personal project is putting together a home server, which involves using tools like **Docker (Compose)** and **Portainer**&mdash;to set up services like PiHole and Jellyfin&mdash;and general networking knowledge as a whole. 🖥️
