## Hi there! 👋
I'm a Computer Science undergrad hoping to specialize in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

At the moment, my academic focuses at the moment are **C++**, **HTML/CSS**, and **computer architecture**. 🔍 Meanwhile, my current personal project is putting together a home server, which involves using tools like **Docker (Compose)** and **Portainer**&mdash;to set up services like PiHole and Jellyfin&mdash;and general networking knowledge as a whole. 🖥️
- 🔭 Currently working on creating a wiki for how I set up my home server as a beginner!
- 🤔 Looking for help with an Obsidian to GitHub Wiki Sync tool :)
- 📫 You can reach me at capyBearista@gmail.com
