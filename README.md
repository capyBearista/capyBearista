I'm Arjun Pramanik, a computer science undergrad who approaches technology with a strategist's mindset. My passion lies at the intersection of hands-on building and high-level problem-solving, influenced by my training in both AI/ML and strategy consulting. I'm fascinated by the foundational technologies—from networks to servers—because understanding the full picture is key to creating elegant, efficient, and secure solutions. Away from the keyboard, I enjoy photography and capturing the world from a different perspective :)
