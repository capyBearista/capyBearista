I'm Arjun Pramanik, a computer science undergrad who loves to build (and occasionally break) things with a strategist's mindset. My experience in everything from AI/ML development to strategy consulting has convinced me that technology's real promise is to solve human problems, not create new ones. I'm passionate about building tech that's private-by-design and puts people first, always asking the big 'why' and 'who benefits' before diving into the 'how.' Away from the keyboard, I enjoy photography and capturing the world from a different perspective :)

### Featured Projects

- [**alien-detector**](https://github.com/capyBearista/alien-detector):   
  *An applied computer vision project built in Python using OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform real-time hand classification. It analyzes webcam landmark data to distinguish 'Alien' hands from 'Human' hands based on finger proportions—a fun exploration of practical ML model integration.*

- [**home-server**](https://github.com/capyBearista/home-server):  
  *A complete guide to building and configuring a home server from scratch, hosting a suite of actually useful services. This project taught me tons about system administration and networking!*

- [**phish-net**](https://github.com/capyBearista/phish-net):  
  *A comprehensive, local-first phishing detection tool built with Python and Streamlit, leveraging the Ollama framework to run a local LLM for all analysis, ensuring no user data is sent to an external server*
